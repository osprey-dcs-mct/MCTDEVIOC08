# basic_ioc RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES to this file you must subsequently
# do a "gnumake rebuild" in this application's top level
# directory.
#
# The build process does not check dependencies against files
# that are outside this application, thus you should do a
# "gnumake rebuild" in the top level directory after EPICS_BASE
# or any other external module pointed to below is rebuilt.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)
#
# This file should ONLY define paths to other support modules,
# or include statements that pull in similar RELEASE files.
# Build settings that are NOT module paths should appear in a
# CONFIG_SITE file.

TEMPLATE_TOP=$(EPICS_BASE)/templates/makeBaseApp/top

# Defines the prebuilt bundle location.

BUNDLE=/controls_sw/prod/centos_stream8-64/bundle_0030

# If not using Asyn, Autosave and/or SNCSEQ, comment out here
# and in $(TOP)/MCTDEVIOC04App/src/Makefile

AUTOSAVE=$(BUNDLE)/epics/autosave
AUTOSAVESETUP=$(BUNDLE)/epics/autosaveSetup

# All IOCs should include standard bundle/IOC status.
#
BUNDLESTATUS=$(BUNDLE)/rproc/bundleStatus
IOCSTATUS=$(BUNDLE)/epics/iocStatus

# All Linux IOCs should perform orderly shutdown in response to sigint and sigterm signals.
#
SIGNAL=$(BUNDLE)/epics/signal

# EPICS_BASE usually appears last so other apps can override stuff:
EPICS_BASE=$(BUNDLE)/epics/base

# Set RULES here if you want to take build rules from somewhere
# other than EPICS_BASE:
#RULES=/path/to/epics/support/module/rules/x-y

# These lines allow developers to override these RELEASE settings
# without having to modify this file directly.
